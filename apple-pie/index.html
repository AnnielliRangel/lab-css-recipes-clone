        This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. 
        I have never seen another one quite like it. 
        It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place prizes in local competitions. 
        I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well!

       <h2>Directions  </h2> 
    
    <ol><li>
      Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring
      to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer. <br>
      Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so
      that it does not run off. <br>
      Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.
